# ReactPortfolio - Portfolio Rendered using React

## Description

This portfolio has been designed to **highlight** some of the accomplishments acheived since beginning the rough, strenuous, and knowledge intensive coding bootcamp program of University of California, Berkeley Extension. It was created with an attempt to **describe** the autor, **navigate** through some of the projects completed since the beginning, and to allow for the user to **communicate** with the author if need be.
The **ReactPortfolio** version was restructured using ***React JavaScript.*** Much of the original HTML code has been modularize to render more efficiently and easier to manage in the long run.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project was to practice the use of **React** and how modularization works to better increase functionality and efficiency of the applications by breaking down its components into smaller apps and rendering using a single js file.

File structuring makes it easier to _debug_ this application. The interface of the React App also adds ease of debugging with instant feedback of what folder/file/line may be problematic to the rendering.
